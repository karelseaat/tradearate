13 be sure to review the app of the other developer in the same browser that you use for Trade A Rate since the localization is important! (donâ€™t forget that you have to install the other developers app)

14 If both developers did the reviews of each others app the Trade A Rate system will detect those reviews in a maximum of nine hours. both party's will be awarded a review point, when you collect 10 point you can do 2 reviews at the same time, when you collect 20 points you can do 3 reviews.

Most important part you have earned a trade point and got a organic review !
