"With this web app you can trade ratings of android apps for ratings of your own android app." = ""
"If you want more honest ratings for your android app and grow your app organically, you might want to give this site/app a try." = ""
"You of course want extra ratings for your app since this will improve your play store score and your app will be higher in rank than other apps of the same category." = ""
"While getting a rating might seem easy, (and it is) it will require some action on your side. The process is simple, you will need to rate someones android app and you will get a rating from that person for your app." = ""
"Also, there are a few rules:" = ""
"a trade of ratings will be successful if both parts have made a rating of an app, if a rating was not successful or done within the time allotted, penalty points are given to the party that didn't give a rating." = ""
"a rating can only be done (on the same device/in the same country) that a trade was made or joined, since a rating is language dependent on the Andoird play store, giving a rating on the wrong language does not get counted." = ""
"a rating needs a score and a text in the android store to be deemed complete in this app." = ""
"If your ratings score drops below zero, you can no longer start trades or join trades. If this happens, we suggest contacting the maintainers of this app to mediate a solution." = ""
"Making a successful trade will add one point to both party's of a trade, failing a trade will subtract ten points of the party that failed to rate the app. and won't add or subtract points to the party that did give a rating." = ""
"In short, there is a heavy penalty for not keeping your end of the bargain!" = ""
"After all that reading, why not go to the trade overview page, join a trade, give a rate and grow your app!" = ""
