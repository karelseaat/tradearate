            <p>This is the frontpage of the treetareet app, with this web app you can trade ratings of android apps for ratings of your own android app.</p>
            <p>If you want more honest ratings for your android app you might want to give this site/app a try.</p>
            <p>You of cource want extra ratings for your app since this will improve your play store score and your app will be higher in rank than others apps of the same category</p>
            <p>While getting a rating might seem easy, (and it is) it will require some action on your site. The process is simple, you will rate someones android app and you will get a rating from that person for your app</p>
            <p>Also there are a few rules, A a trade of ratings will be sucessfull if both partys have made a rating of an app, if a rating was not sucessfull or done withing the time alloted, penalty poins are awarded to both partys</p>
            <p>B a rating can only be done (on the same device/in the same country) that a trade was made or joined, since a trating is language dependant on the andoird play store</p>
            <p>C a ating needs a score and a text in the android store to be deemed complete in this app<p/>
